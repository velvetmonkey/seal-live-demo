# Limitations

These limits are part of the Seal claim. They are not footnotes.

<!-- Canonical copy of the non-claims block. README + docs/THREAT-MODEL.md mirror it verbatim between the same markers; edit here first. scripts/claims-drift.mjs enforces equality. -->
<!-- claims:begin -->
- Seal proves properties of the mediation KERNEL, not of the whole deployed system.
- Seal does NOT prove SHA-256 collision resistance in Lean; it is a named, scoped cryptographic assumption (A-CR).
- The deployed Rust / wasm / JS are NOT proven bug-free; they are tied to the proof by byte-exact conformance testing over a corpus, not for every possible input.
- Seal guarantees AUTHORIZATION match, not INTENT match: if a human approves a malicious-but-valid request, Seal will execute it.
- Seal does NOT prevent compromise of hosts, browsers, build systems, keys, operators, or downstream tools.
- Seal's audit chain is tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-IMPOSSIBLE.
- Seal does NOT make the AI smarter or prevent hallucinations; it stops an unapproved effect.
- Axiom footprint {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} is the minimal classical fragment; no extra axioms.
- The axiom-footprint line is a per-theorem ceiling for theorems named in the family's axiom-pin gates; it is not a repository-wide census. Pin scope and named exceptions are indexed in the seal claims matrix (seal/docs/CLAIMS-MATRIX.md).
