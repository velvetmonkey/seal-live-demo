# Truth box (canonical)

<!-- Canonical copy of the truth-box claim block for this repo: runtime profile,
     claim, non-claim. The README mirrors these three lines verbatim between the
     same markers. The "Map" line is per-repo and is NOT part of this block. Keeping
     this file byte-identical to the other seal repos' docs/TRUTH-BOX.md is an
     unenforced, human-maintained convention. Edit here first; scripts/claims-drift.mjs
     checks that claim blocks agree within this repository. -->

<!-- truthbox:begin -->
> **Runtime profile: `compatible`.** Strict `canonical-l0` is proved and modelled, not the deployed route yet.
> **Claim:** policy-covered request-effects recognised by the compatible MCP boundary reach the downstream child MCP server only after every applicable Lean kernel returns Allow. Effects configured as guarded additionally require a matching live approval record. Seam failures block; every mediated decision emits replayable evidence.
> **Non-claim:** the deployed host is not proved end to end, and canonical parser rejection is not currently the runtime gate. Host `ApprovalRecord` tokens are a separate signed channel from the v2 kernel-defined approval tuple. “Canonical” in Seal names the pinned kernel byte rule, not RFC 8785/JCS. Seal verifies the configured authorization evidence. Whether that evidence represents the intended human, device or service is an identity and key-custody assumption, not a proved property.
